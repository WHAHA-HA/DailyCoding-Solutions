PROBLEM 84:

Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. 
A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring and their perimeter is surrounded by water.


EXAMPLE:

Input = 1 0 0 0 0
        0 0 1 1 0
        0 1 1 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0
        1 1 0 0 1
        1 1 0 0 1
Output = 4 (this matrix has 4 islands)
