PROBLEM 42:

Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. 
If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.
Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.


EXAMPLE:
Input = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2], 24
Output = [12, 9, 2, 1]
