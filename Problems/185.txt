PROBLEM 185:

Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.


EXAMPLE:

rectangle1 = {
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
rectangle2 = {
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions" (4, 3) # width, height
}
Output = 6
