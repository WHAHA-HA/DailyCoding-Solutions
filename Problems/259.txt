PROBLEM 259:

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

Player 1: g
Player 2: h
Player 1: o
Player 2: s
Player 1: t [loses]
Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is ["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"], the only winning start letter would be b.
