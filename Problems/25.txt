PROBLEM 25:

Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:
. (period) which matches any single character
* (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element
That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.


EXAMPLE:

Input = "ra.", "ray"
Output = True

Input = "ra.", "raymond"
Output = False
