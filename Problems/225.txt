PROBLEM 225:

There are N prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. 
The executions are carried out starting with the kth person, and removing every successive kth person going clockwise until there is no one left.
Given N and k, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.
Bonus: Find an O(log N) solution if k = 2.


EXAMPLE:

N = 5
k = 2
Output = 3 (sequence will be [2, 4, 1, 5, 3])
