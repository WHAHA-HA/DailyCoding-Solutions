PROBLEM 143:

Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts.
* The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x
* The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x
* The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10], 10
Output = [9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14]
