PROBLEM 241:

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. 
It is calculated as follows:
A researcher has index h if at least h of her N papers have h citations each. 
If there are multiple h satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.
Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.


EXAMPLE:

N = 5
citations = [4, 3, 0, 1, 5]
Output = 3 (since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations)
