PROBLEM 149:

Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j) which returns the sum from the sublist L[i:j] (including i, excluding j).
You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. sum() should be optimized over the pre-processing step.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1, 3 
Output = 5 (sum([2, 3]))
