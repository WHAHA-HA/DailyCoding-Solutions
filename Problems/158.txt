PROBLEM 158:

You are given an N * M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?
You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [[0, 0, 1],
         [0, 0, 1],
         [1, 0, 0]]
Output = 2
(As there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:
* Right, down, down, right
* Down, right, down, right
The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.)
