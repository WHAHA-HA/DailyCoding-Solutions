PROBLEM 256:

Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.
For example, given the following tree:

         a
      /     \
    b         c
  /            \
d                 e
  \             /   \
    f          g     h
You should convert it to:
     a
  /     \
f         e
        /   \
       g     h
