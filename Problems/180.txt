PROBLEM 180:

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. 
This should be done in-place.
Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.
Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]

Input = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output = [1, 4, 2, 3]
