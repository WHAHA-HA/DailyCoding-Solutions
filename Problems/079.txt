PROBLEM 79:

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [10, 5, 7] 
Output = true (since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing)

Input [10, 5, 1]
Output = false (since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array)
