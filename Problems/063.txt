PROBLEM 63:

You are given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word.
Write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.


EXAMPLE:

Mat =  [['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
        ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
        ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
        ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]

Word = 'FOAM'
Output = true (since it's the leftmost column)
Word = 'MASS'
Output = true (since it's the last row)
