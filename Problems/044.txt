PROBLEM 44:

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. 
Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j. 
That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.
You may assume each element in the array is distinct.


EXAMPLE:
Input = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output = 3 <(2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3)>

Input = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
Output = 10 <every distinct pair forms an inversion>
