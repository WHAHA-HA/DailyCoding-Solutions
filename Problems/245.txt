PROBLEM 245:

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element.
Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]
Output = 2 (as the optimal solution involves jumping from 6 to 5, and then from 5 to 9)
