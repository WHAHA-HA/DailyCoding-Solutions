PROBLEM 60:

Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10]
Output = true (since we can split it up into {15, 5, 10, 15, 10} and {20, 35}, which both add up to 55)

Input = [15, 5, 20, 10, 35]
Output = false (since we can't split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum)
