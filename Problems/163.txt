PROBLEM 163:

Given an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation, write a program to evaluate it.
The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. 
You can assume the given expression is always valid.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [5, 3, '+']
Output = 8 [5 + 3]

Input = [15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-'] 
Output = 5 [((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1))]
