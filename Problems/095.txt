PROBLEM 95:

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. 
If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.
Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the input memory)?


EXAMPLE:

Input = [1,2,3]
Output = [1,3,2]

Input = [1,3,2]
Output = [2,1,3]

Input = [3,2,1]
Output = [1,2,3]
