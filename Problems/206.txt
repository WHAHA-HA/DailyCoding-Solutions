PROBLEM 206:

A permutation can be specified by an array P, where P[i] represents the location of the element at i in the permutation. 
For example, [2, 1, 0] represents the permutation where elements at the index 0 and 2 are swapped.
Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. 


EXAMPLE:

Array = ["a", "b", "c"] 
Permutation = [2, 1, 0]
Output = ["c", "b", "a"]
