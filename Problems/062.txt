PROBLEM 62:

There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. 
Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. 
You can only move right or down.


EXAMPLE:

Input = 2, 2
Output = 2 (since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:
* Right, then down
* Down, then right)

Input = 5, 5
Output = 70
