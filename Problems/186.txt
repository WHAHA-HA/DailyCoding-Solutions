PROBLEM 186:

You are given an array of positive integers. 
Divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Output = {10, 25}, {5, 15, 20} (which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference)
