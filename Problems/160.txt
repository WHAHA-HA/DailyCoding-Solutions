PROBLEM 160:

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.
The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.


EXAMPLE:

Input:
Tree =     a
          /|\
         b c d
            / \
           e   f
          / \
         g   h
weights: a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1 
Output = 17 (the longest path would be c -> a -> d -> f, with a length of 17)
