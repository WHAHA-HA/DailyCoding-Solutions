PROBLEM 193:

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock. 
You're also given a number fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.
You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many transactions as you like.


EXAMPLE:

Array = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10]
Fee = 2
Output = 9 
(Since you could buy the stock at $1, and sell at $8, and then buy it at $4 and sell it at $10.
Since we did two transactions, there is a $4 fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus $4 of fees.)
