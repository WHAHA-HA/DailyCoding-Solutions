PROBLEM 50:

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'
Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.


EXAMPLE:

Input =
    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
Output = 45 [(3 + 2) * (4 + 5)]
