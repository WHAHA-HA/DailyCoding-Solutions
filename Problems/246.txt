PROBLEM 246:

Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle.
A word X can be placed in front of another word Y in a circle if the last character of X is same as the first character of Y.

Input = ['chair', 'height', 'racket', 'touch', 'tunic']
Output = chair -> racket -> touch -> height -> tunic -> chair
