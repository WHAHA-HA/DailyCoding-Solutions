'''
Problem:

Given a string and a set of delimiters, reverse the words in the string while maintaining the relative order of the delimiters. 
Follow-up: Does your solution work for the following cases: "hello/world:here/", "hello//world:here"

Example:

Input = "hello/world:here"
Output = "here/world:hello"
