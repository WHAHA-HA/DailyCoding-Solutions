'''
Problem:
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. 
That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

Example:
Input = [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5] 
Output = [2, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 2, 2, 2]
