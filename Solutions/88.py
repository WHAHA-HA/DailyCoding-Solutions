"""
Problem:

Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication, or modulus operators. 
Return the quotient as an integer, ignoring the remainder.

# FUNCTION TO PERFORM THE OPERATION
def div(dividend, divisor):
    # if the divisor is 0, division is not possible
    if divisor == 0:

    while dividend > 0:
        # divisor is subtracted from the dividend
