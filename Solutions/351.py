Problem:

Word sense disambiguation is the problem of determining which sense a word takes on in
a particular setting, if that word has multiple meanings. For example, in the sentence
"I went to get money from the bank", bank probably means the place where people deposit
money, not the land beside a river or lake.

Suppose you are given a list of meanings for several words, formatted like so:

{
    "word_1": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...],
    ...
    "word_n": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...]
}
Given a sentence, most of whose words are contained in the meaning list above, create
an algorithm that determines the likely sense of each possibly ambiguous word.

# NOTE: The problem is incomplete.
# We also need a source for which word appears in which context, 
# to be able to infer this in the actual sentences.
# Once we have a set of strongly correlated words with each word-sense,
# we can searchthe context of a word in the target sentence.
# If there is a high overlap of those words with the already correlated words 
# for a particular word sense, we can guess that that is the answer.
