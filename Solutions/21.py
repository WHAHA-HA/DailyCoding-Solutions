'''
Problem:

Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

Example:

Input = [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]
Output = 2

# FUNCTION TO PERFORM THE OPERATION

    # Creating an empty dictionary to store the rooms required (+ve for start, -ve for end)
    D = {}

    # Populating the dictionary
    for v in intervals:

    # Looping over the events and checking the number of rooms required 
    # If a class ends, the value in the dict is -ve, so upon addition, it reduces the number of rooms required
