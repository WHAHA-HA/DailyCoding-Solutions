Problem:

An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two people
can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is k,
determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights [100, 200, 150, 80] and a boat limit of
200, the smallest number of boats required will be three.
