Problem:

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.
More rigorously, we can define it as follows:
* The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
* The horizontal distance of a left child is hd(parent) - 1.
* The horizontal distance of a right child is hd(parent) + 1.
For example, for the following tree, hd(1) = -2, and hd(6) = 0.
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8
The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. 
If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.
Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be [0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9].
