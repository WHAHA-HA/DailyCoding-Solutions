"""
Problem:

You are given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice. 
Find the two elements that appear only once.
Follow-up: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?

Example:

Input = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10]
Output = 4, 8 (The order does not matter)
