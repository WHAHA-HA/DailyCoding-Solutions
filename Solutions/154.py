Problem:

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:
* push(item), which adds an element to the stack
* pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:
* push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
* pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap

stack.push(4)

print(stack.pop())

# Error
