```
Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism:

- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Parametric polymorphism
- Subtype polymorphism
```

## Ad-hoc polymorphism

-   Allow multiple functions that perform an operation on different
-   add(int, int) and add(str, str) would be separately implemented

## Parametric polymorphism

-   This allows a function to deal with generics, and therefore on any concrete definition of the generic.
-   e.g. A List type in Java, regardless of which objects are in the list

## Subtype polymorphism

-   This allows subclass instances to be treated by a function they same way as it would superclass instances
-   e.g. Instances of Cat will be operated on a function the same way as instances of it's superclass Animal.
