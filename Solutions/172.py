'''
Problem:

Given a string s and a list of words words, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in s that is a concatenation of every word in words exactly once.
The order of the indices does not matter.

Example:
s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog"
words = ["cat", "dog"]
Output = [0, 13] (since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13)

s = "barfoobazbitbyte"
words = ["dog", "cat"]
Output = [] (since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in s)
