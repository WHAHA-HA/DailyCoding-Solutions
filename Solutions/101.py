Problem:

Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.
A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.


EXAMPLE:

Input: 4 
Output: 2, 2 (2 + 2 = 4. If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution)

(If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, 
then [a, b] < [c, d] if a < c or a==c and b < d)
