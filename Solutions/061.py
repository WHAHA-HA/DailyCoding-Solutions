"""
Problem:

Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.
Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

Example:
2, 10 => 1024

# FUNCTION TO PERFORM THE OPERATION
def pow(base, power):
    # this function implements a method similar to binary search, the effective complexity is O(log(n))

        return 1
    # if the exponent is odd, the result is given by [base ^ exp = ((base * base) ^ floor(exp / 2)) * base]
    elif power % 2 != 0:
