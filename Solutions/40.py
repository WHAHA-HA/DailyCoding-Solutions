Problem:

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.
Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

Example:
[6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6] => 1
"""

# We can sum the bits in same positions for all the numbers and take modulo with 3.
# The bits for which sum is not multiple of 3, are the bits of number with single occurrence.
# Let us consider the example array {9, 8, 9, 9}. The 1001, 1000, 1001, 1001
# Sum of first bits (2 ^ 0) % 3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) % 3 = 0
# Sum of second bits (2 ^ 1) % 3 = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) % 3 = 0
# Sum of third bits (2 ^ 2) % 3 = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) % 3 = 0
# Sum of fourth bits (2 ^ 3) % 3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) % 3 = 1
# Hence number which appears once is 1000
