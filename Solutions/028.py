Problem:

Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line
length k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.

More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There should
be at least one space between each word. Pad extra spaces when necessary so that each
line has exactly length k. Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with
the extra spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.

If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side with
spaces.

Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.

For example, given the list of words
["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"] and k = 16, you
should return the following:

["the quick brown", # 1 extra space on the left "fox jumps over", # 2 extra spaces
distributed evenly "the lazy dog" # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly]
