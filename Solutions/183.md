## Problem:

Describe what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter.

## Process of a URL being fetched

1. The browser's host resolution cache is checked if the website's IP is stored.
2. If the IP is not found, a request is sent to the Domain Name Service (DNS) for the IP of the host/load balancing host.
3. A HTTP GET request is sent to the host (server).
4. The host responds with a payload (usually in HTML).
5. Browser renders the received HTML.
6. The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, CSS, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-4 to perform step 5.
7. Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further asynchronous requests as needed.
