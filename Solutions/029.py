Problem:

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is
to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For
example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded
have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string
to be decoded is valid.
