Problem:

Suppose you are given two lists of n points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. 
Imagine a set of n line segments connecting each point pi to qi. 
Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

# FUNCTION TO PERFORM THE OPERATION

    # getting the line segments
    segments = list(zip(arr1, arr2))
    # initializing count
    count = 0

    # iterating through the lists of points
    for i in range(len(segments)):
        p1_start, p1_end = segments[i]

        # checking if any other points intersect it
        for p2_start, p2_end in segments[:i]:
            if ((p1_start < p2_start and p1_end > p2_end) or (p1_start > p2_start and p1_end < p2_end)):
                count += 1
