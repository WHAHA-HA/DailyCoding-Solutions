Problem:

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of 7, or the sum of unique powers of 7. 
The first few sevenish numbers are 1, 7, 8, 49, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.

# FUNCTION TO PERFORM THE OPERATION
def get_sevenish_num(number):
    curr = 1
    curr_iteration = 1

    while (curr < number):
        curr_iteration += 1
        curr += curr_iteration
    
    curr -= curr_iteration
    
    result = 7 ** (curr_iteration - 1)
    curr_to_add = 1

    for _ in range(number - curr - 1):
        result += curr_to_add
        curr_to_add *= 7

    return result


# DRIVER CODE
print(get_sevenish_num(1)) # 1 = 7 ^ 0
print(get_sevenish_num(2)) # 7 = 7 ^ 1
print(get_sevenish_num(3)) # 8 = 7 ^ 0 + 7 ^ 1
print(get_sevenish_num(4)) # 49 = 7 ^ 2
print(get_sevenish_num(5)) # 50 = 7 ^ 0 + 7 ^ 2
print(get_sevenish_num(6)) # 57 = 7 ^ 0 + 7 ^ 1 + 7 ^ 2
