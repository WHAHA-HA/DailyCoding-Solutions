"""
Problem:

You are given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order. 
Write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. 
You must buy before you can sell it.

Example:

[9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10] => 5 (since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars)
