# Daily Coding Challenge
This is a repository containing the problems and solutions for the problems available at Daily Coding Problem (solutions given in python).
Each of the solution is heavily documented for ease of understanding.

## How to Use
You can try out the problems yourself given the problems folder or if you want to, you can also directly dive into the solution (though trying the problem first is highly recommended).

The requirements have been added to requirements.txt
To install the 3rd party packages, perform the following steps:
* Open CMD/Terminal/Powershell in the directory containing requirements.txt (as administrator in Windows).
* Run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (add sudo before the command if you are using a Linux based system).

## Note
You can enroll for the problems at https://www.dailycodingproblem.com.
This repository is a work in progress, everyday 1 to 2 problems will be uploaded.
